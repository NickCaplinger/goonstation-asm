# goonstation-asm

This project provides an assembler that converts instructions into opcodes for [Goonstation's Control Unit](https://wiki.ss13.co/Control_Unit). If you don't play [Space Station 13](https://spacestation13.com/) on [Goonstation's servers](https://wiki.ss13.co/Main_Page), this probably isn't useful to you. :)
